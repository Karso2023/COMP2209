Add : 

pops the top two elements of the stack

adds them and pushes the result back on to the stack


Sub:

Subtracts the top two elements of the stack

Subtracts them and pushes the result back on to the stack


Mul:

Multiply the top two elements of the stack

Multiply them and pushes the result back on to the stack


Div:

Divide the top two elements of the stack

divide them and pushes the result back on to the stack


Dup:

Pushes another copy of the top element on to the stack


Pop:

Removes the top element of the stack 



## Have to consider how each operation behaves on the Nothing value 

Adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing:

Either argument being Nothing pushes Nothing back on to the stack.


Attempting division by a zero value pushes Nothing on to the stack. 

The Dup and Pop operations duplicate and pop Nothing values as if they were any other values.



## Reduction Sequence 

Stack machine is a reduction sequence for a given input stack S if: 

It does not use any Dup instructions

The resulting stack contains a single value


## Maximal reduction sequence for a stack S

The resulting single value is maximum among all possible reduction sequences for S.

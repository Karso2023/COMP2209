-- parseMove :: Board -> Colour -> String -> (Piece,[Loc],Loc,(Maybe Int,Maybe Int),Bool)

-- that, given a board state, a colour to say which player is to make the next move, and a string SAN move, returns a 5-tuple of information as follows:

-- Which type of piece is being moved
-- The source locations of all of the player's pieces of this type on the board
-- The target location of the move
-- A pair of possible locations representing extra disambiguating information used to identify the exact piece being moved.
-- A boolean value indicating whether an opponent's piece is taken in this move

-- BNF
-- <move> ::=  <location> |  'x' <location> | <piece> <location> | <piece> 'x' <location> 
-- <piece> ::= <pieceName> | <pieceName> <row> | <pieceName> <col> | <pieceName> <col> <row> 
-- <pieceName> ::= 'N' | 'B' | 'R' | 'Q' | 'K'
-- <col> ::= 'a' | ... | 'h'
-- <row> ::= 1 | ... | 8
-- <location> ::= <col> <row>
